## Description
We are using the FATS package to extract features (e.g. mean, std, amplitude of the magnitude) of 100,000 Large Magellanic Cloud 
stars from the OGLE database. The goal is to use the features of these stars and apply random forest on them to predict how the
light curves will look like in the future.
